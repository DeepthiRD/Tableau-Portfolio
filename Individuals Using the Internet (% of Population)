The Data Challendge from *MakeOver Monday Week 45 2024*

the data contains proportion of people that use the internet across the world.

Used Tableau for Data Analysis and Data Visualization. 

Data Densification / Data Scaffolding
Data densification is a common technique used in Tableau.
I think it’s important to note that data densification is very closely related to data scaffolding.
In fact, I often struggle to delineate the two. Both create a sort of artificial structure within your data for the purpose of creating a specific type of data visualization. 
I’ll distinguish between the two by saying that data densification is more focused on adding additional records (or points) within your data so that you can draw something more advanced.

Data Densification is required to get a Sigmoid Curve for Visualization .

Following Calculations where created to get the Sigmoid Curve on the Visualization.

Calculation 1 : #point =25

Calculation 2 : startX = 

CASE [Group ]
WHEN "70%-80%" THEN -150
WHEN "80%-90%" THEN 10
WHEN "90%-100%" THEN 100
END

Calculation 3 : startY = -90 


Calculation 4: sigmoidfunction = 1/(1 + EXP(0.1)^ -(([Point]-([#point]+1)/2)*([endY - latitude]-[start Y])/([#point]-1)))

Calculation 5: CurveX = [startX] + ([endX - longitude] - [startX]) * [sigmoid function ]

Calculation 6: CurveY = [start Y] + ([Point]-1) * ([endY - latitude] - [start Y]) / ([#point]-1)

Calculation 7: endpoint = [Point] = [#point]

Calculation 8: Group = IF ([2023 (Yr2023)]>70.00 and [2023 (Yr2023)]<80.00) THEN "70%-80%"
ELSEIF ([2023 (Yr2023)]>80.00 and [2023 (Yr2023)]<90.00) THEN "80%-90%"
ELSEIF ([2023 (Yr2023)]>90.00 and [2023 (Yr2023)]<=100.00) THEN "90%-100%"
END

Calculation 9: True = True

Calculation 10: False = False

Add CurveX to Columns and CurveY to Rows .
Add CurveX again to the Columns and Create a Dual Axis .
For one CurveX Mark select Line Chart and for another CurveX chart select Circle Marks.

*Format As Required*
